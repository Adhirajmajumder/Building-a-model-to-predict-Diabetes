# Building-a-model-to-predict-Diabetes
The given dataset lists the glucose level readings of several pregnant women taken either during a survey examination or routine medical care. It specifies if the 2-hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 200 mg/dl. Analyze the dataset

1) Calculating the features of the dataset,

2) Calculating the response label of the dataset,

3) Create a model  to predict the diabetes outcome,

4) Use training and testing datasets to train the model, and

5) Check the accuracy of the model.
